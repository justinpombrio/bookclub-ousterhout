## Chapter 3: Working Code is not Enough (Strategic vs. Tactial Programming)

Two ways of programming: tactical vs. strategic.

- **Tactical programming:** get features out the door as quickly as possible, quality of the code
  base be damned. A "tactical tornado" is a developer that excels at this. Very productive, but
  leaves a trail of destruction in their wake.
- **Strategic programming:** "invest time to improve the design of the system". E.g. by
  brainstorming multiple approaches beforehand, documenting well, and housecleaning after the fact.

Suggestion: spend 10-20% of developer time on improving existing code. As anyone who has seen a poor
quality code base knows, "poor code quality slows development by at least 20%". (I think that's a
major understatement!)

Ousterhouse is against technical debt, even for startups, under all circumstances, because:

- Investing in code quality pays off quite quickly.
- Poor code quality decreases morale, and scares off the best developers.

I think he's being a little overzealous. On _rare_ occasions, there's a business opportunity that
pays off greatly if you can take it _right now_, and it can be worth taking on technical debt to
make it. However, the math only works out if this sort of thing is rare; if it is common, then
strategic programming dominates again.
