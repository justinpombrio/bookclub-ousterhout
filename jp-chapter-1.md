## Chapter 1: It's All About Complexity

Thank God, someone else realizes that complexity management is one of the biggest obstacles to
software development.

**Terminology Note:** Ousterhout uses the phrase "agile software development" in it's _initial_
usage, as described by, e.g., the [Manifesto for Agile Software
Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/).  However, this should not be confused with the _common
usage_ of "agile". For example, in the last year, Commure started using a lot more agile terminology
while moving markedly _away from_ agile software development as originally conceived. This has
become common enough that some of the authors of the Manifesto think it's time to retire the word
"agile".

I like the idea of the "Taking it too far" sections. Reminds me of Robert Nystrom's [Game
Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) book, which introduces a bunch of design
patterns, and says when you should _and should not_ use each one. (Fantastic book.)
